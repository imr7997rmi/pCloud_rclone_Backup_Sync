 Session Management](screen-management.md) for long-running backups
- Set up automated scheduling using cron or Synology Task Scheduler
- Configure monitoring and alerting for backup completion

## Security Considerations

- **Credentials**: Never hardcode credentials in the script
- **Permissions**: Ensure backup destination has appropriate access controls
- **Network**: Consider VPN usage for remote backups
- **Encryption**: Enable rclone encryption for sensitive data

```bash
# Example with encryption
rclone sync pCloud:/sensitive encrypted-remote:/backup \
    --crypt-password="your-encryption-password"
```
